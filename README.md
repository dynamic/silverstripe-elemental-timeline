## Example configuration (optional)

If your module makes use of the config API in SilverStripe it's a good idea to provide an example config
 here that will get the module working out of the box and expose the user to the possible configuration options.

Provide a yaml code example where possible.

```yaml

Page:
  config_option: true
  another_config:
    - item1
    - item2
  
```
